# Scraper
Grocery Store Scraper 
This project demonstrates web scraping Instacart's stores to extract items and their prices using Selenium WebDriver.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x (or higher) installed
Selenium WebDriver library installed (pip install selenium)
WebDriver executable for your preferred browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome) downloaded and configured
Usage
Clone or download the project.

Install the required dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open scrape_instacart.py and modify the search_term variable to specify the store or location to scrape.

Run the script:

Copy code
python scrape_instacart.py
The script will launch a web browser, navigate to Instacart, and scrape the items and prices.

Check the output file or database for the scraped data.

Notes
Respect the website's terms of service and legal guidelines while scraping.

Update the code if Instacart modifies its website structure.

Implement appropriate rate limiting and scraping practices to avoid server overload.

Customize the code and output format as needed.
